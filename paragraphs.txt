It all depends on what you want. You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin – to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours – closer than you keep it yourself.
But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you.
We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid – but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.

A time may come soon, when none will return. Then there will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds that are done in the last defence of your homes.
Yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.
